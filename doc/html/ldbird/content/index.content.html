### Introduction ###

LDBIRD is a command-line program for rapidly computing LD metrics between all pairs of variants in its input files.

#### How fast is LDBIRD? ####

LDBIRD is very likely not the fastest way to compute LD - it was written to meet my immediate need of assessing the
distribution of LD in *P.falciparum* populations. It limits itself to loading variants one (or rather two) at a time,
and this its algorithm is quadratic algorithm in the number of variants. If LDBIRD doesn't meet your needs, other
possibly faster ways to compute LD are to use <a href="https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/">plink</a> or <a
href="http://www.christianbenner.com/">LDStore</a> or <a href="https://tskit.dev/tskit/docs/stable/">tskit</a>.

For an introduction to running LDBIRD, please see the <a href="[ROOT]/documentation/getting_started.html">getting
started</a> page.

### Obtaining LDBIRD ###

LDBIRD is currently included as part of the <a href="https://code.enkre.net/qctool">QCTOOL
package</a>, which is currently hosted at <a href="https://code.enkre.net">code.enkre.net</a>. See
the <a href="[ROOT]/documentation/download.html">download page</a> for full details on obtaining
and installing LDBIRD.
