				Per-sample summary statistics
			</div>
			<div class="task_notes">
				The <code>-sample-stats</code> option can be used to compute per-sample summary statistics.
				The output goes to a file specified by the <code>-osample</code> option.  E.g:
			</div>
			<div class="task_command_line">
				$ qctool -g example.bgen -s example.sample -sample-stats -osample sample-stats.txt
			</div>
			<div class="task_notes">

					This computes per-sample summary statistics (average missingness and heterozygosity) and places
					them in the file <Code>sample-stats.txt</code>.  Additionally, if array intensity data
					is available (see <a href="intensities.html">processing intensity data</a>), average X channel, Y
					channel, total (X+Y) and difference (X-Y) of intensities will be computed.
					These can be used useful for QC purposes - for example,
					average intensity on the X and Y chromosomes can be used to directly determine sample gender.

					<b>Note:</b> the output file can be formatted in various of ways, controlled by the file extension.
					See the page on <a href="../summary_file_formats.html">summary statistic file formats</a> for

				Per-variant summary statistics
			</div>
			<div class="task_notes">
				The basic option to compute per-variant summary statistics is <code>-snp-stats</code>.  E.g.:
			</div>
			<div class="task_command_line">
				$ qctool -g example.bgen -snp-stats -osnp snp-stats.txt
			</div>
			<div class="task_notes">
				<p>
					This will compute genotype counts, allele counts and frequencies, missing data rates, info metrics, and a P-value
					against the null that genotypes are in Hardy-Weinberg proportions in diploid samples.  Output is sent to the
					file specified in the <code>-osnp</code> option.  See the page on <a href="../summary_file_formats.html">summary statistic file formats</a> for
					information on output file formatting.
				</p>
				<p>
					Analysis on the sex chromosomes is complicated by the fact that males and females have differing ploidy.
					To process sex chromosomes correctly, QCTOOL relies on the ploidy being correct in the input genotype files.
					However, some data sets (and some file formats) instead encode males as diploid homozygotes.
					The <code>-infer-ploidy-from</code> can be used to deal with such data - see the
					page on <a href="inferring_ploidy.html">inferring ploidy</a> .
				</p>
				<p>
					For sex chromosomes, QCTOOL outputs both diploid and haploid
					genotype counts, as well an appropriate allele frequency, a sex-chromosome specific info metric,
					and a test for difference in frequency between males and females.

			<div class="task_name">
				Differential missingness
			</div>
			<div class="task_notes">
				It's often useful to compare levels of missingness between different samples.  The <code>-differential</code>
				option can be used to compare levels of missingness between samples having different levels of a covariate
				in the sample file.  E.g.:
			</div>
			<div class="task_command_line">
				$ qctool -g example.bgen -s example.sample -osnp snp-stats.txt -differential &lt;column&gt;
			</div>
			<div class="task_notes">
				This computes: the count of missing and non-missing genotypes in each level of the covariate specified in
				the specified column, and a likelihood ratio test P-value comparing missing data rates in the different levels.
				Additionally, if the covariate has exactly two levels, a Fishers exact test P-value is also computed.

				Combining options
			</div>
			<div class="task_notes">
				Summary statistic options can be combined; e.g:
			</div>
			<div class="task_command_line">
				$ qctool -g example.bgen -s example.sample -osnp snp-stats.txt -differential &lt;column&gt;
			</div>
			<div class="task_notes">
				This computes both basic summary statistics and values for differential missingness, and places it in the same output file.
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="task">
			<div class="task_name">
				Stratifying summary statistics
			</div>
			<div class="task_notes">
				The <code>-stratify</code> option can be used to compute summary statistics stratified over
				subsets of the data. E.g.:
			</div>
			<div class="task_command_line">
				$ qctool -g example.bgen -s example.sample -snp-stats -osnp snp-stats.txt -stratify &lt;column&gt;
			</div>
			<div class="task_notes">
				<p>The argument must be the name of a column in the sample file containing discrete
					values (i.e. it must be of type <code>B</code> or <code>D</code>).  Summary statistic calculations will
				be computed for each subset of samples having the same value in that column.
				The output will contain the same fields as for <code>-snp-stats</code>, but each column will
				appear multiple times with a suffix of the form <code>[&lt;column&gt;=&lt;value&gt;]</code>
				to denote which strata the values are computed for.
			</p>

					This feature has several possible use cases - for example, it can be used to compute allele counts across ethnic groups in a
					sample of mixed ancestry, or to inspect deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium seperately in disease cases and controls.
