# Introduction #

HPTEST is a command-line utility program that implements association tests between all pairs of variants in two sets of
genotypes on the same samples. The motivating use case is to test for association between genetic variants in a host
and pathogen, but HPTEST also has other possible use-cases, such as estimating LD between variants while controlling
for confounding variables.

HPTEST currently implements a logistic regression method in one set of genotypes (e.g. host genotypes) are included as
predictors and a second set (e.g. pathogen genotypes) are included as the outcome. Named covariates can also be
included. For the predictor variable, imputed genotypes are supported for the predictor variable; in this case the <a

distribution.

For an introduction to running HPTEST, please see the <a href="[ROOT]/documentation/basic_usage.html">Basic usage</a>
page.
