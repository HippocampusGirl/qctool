### Introduction ###

HPTEST is a command-line program to test for association between genotypes at pairs of genetic
variants. The motivating use case is to test for association between hosts and pathogens, using
genotype data from hosts and from the pathogens infecting those hosts, but HPTEST also has other
potential use-cases, such as estimating LD between variants while controlling for confounding
variables.

The method currently implemented in HPTEST is logistic regression in which one set of genotypes
(e.g. the host genotypes) are included as predictors and the second set (e.g. pathogen genotypes)
are included as the outcome. Covariates can also be included. For each pair of variants, HPTEST
outputs the genotype counts and a summary of the evidence for association.

For an introduction to running HPTEST, please see the <a
href="[ROOT]/documentation/getting_started.html">getting started</a> page.

### Obtaining and running HPTEST ###

HPTEST is currently included as part of the <a href="https://code.enkre.net/qctool">QCTOOL
package</a>, which is currently hosted at <a href="https://code.enkre.net">code.enkre.net</a>. See
the <a href="[ROOT]/documentation/download.html">download page</a> for full details on obtaining
and installing HPTEST.
