### The sqlite output format ###

If you use an output file of one of the following forms:
	
* ``myfile.sqlite``
* ``myfile.sqlite:&lt;name&gt;``
* ``sqlite://myfile.sqlite``
* ``sqlite://myfile.sqlite:&lt;name&gt;``

then HPTEST will output results to a sqlite file instead of a flat file.  This has the following behaviour:

* The analysis, its start/stop times and command-line arguments are recorded in the ``Analysis``,
  ``AnalysisStatus``, and ``AnalysisProoerty`` tables.

* The main results are placed in a table called ``name``; if no name is supplied then the table is
  called ``analysis&lt;n&gt;`` where n is one more than the number of analyses currently recorded
  in the `Analysis` table, if any.
  
* The main results table does not contain full variant information; instead, genetic variants are
  placed into a seperate ``Variant`` table. A view called ``nameView`` is also created which links
  the main result, ``Analysis``, and ``Variant`` tables through the ``analysis_id``,
  ``predictor_id`` and ``outcome_id`` fields.

* The main results table is indexed by default by the ``predictor_id`` and ``outcome_id`` fields.

* You can record more than one analysis in the same sqlite file. The only caveat is that analyses
  that output different column names have to be stored in different results tables.

### Using the sqlite output file programmatically ###

Data from the sqlite output files can be read directly into analysis programs.
For example, suppose you have named the output table ``Result``.  Then in R:
```R
library( RSQLite )
db = DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "myfile.sqlite" )
data = dbGetQuery( db, "SELECT * FROM ResultView LIMIT 100" )
```

...or if you are using the <a href="https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org">tidyverse</a>:
```R
library( dplyr )
db = DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "myfile.sqlite")
results = tbl( db, "ResultView" )
results
```

Or it can be loaded in python using <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org">pandas</a>:
```python
import pandas
db = sqlite3.connect( "myfile.sqlite" )
pandas.read_sql(
	"SELECT * FROM ResultView LIMIT 100" ),
	db
)
```
