###Obtaining HPTEST###

The source code to HPTEST is available as part of the QCTOOL package, which is currently hosted at
<a href="https://code.enkre.net/qctool">code.enkre.net</a>. To obtain HPTEST you need to download
version 2.1.9 or above of QCTOOL. The source code can be downloaded from the following link:

<a href="https://code.enkre.net/qctool/zip/v2.1.9/qctool.tgz">https://code.enkre.net/qctool/zip/v2.1.9/qctool.tgz</a>

Please be aware this tarball is generated on the fly and may take a few minutes to download.

###Compiling HPTEST###

QCTOOL uses the <a href="https://waf.io">Waf build system</a> to manage the compilation process.
For this to work you need python to be installed. (Waf itself is bundled with QCTOOL). A basic
compilation process goes as follows:

```
$ ./waf configure
$ ./waf
```

The first command configures the project (i.e. makes sure various prerequisites are in place). The
second part compiles the QCTOOL package.  

If successful you should now be able to try hptest:

```
$ ./build/release/apps/hptest_v2.1.9
!! Error (OptionProcessingException): Option "-o" must be supplied..
!! Run hptest -help for usage information.
```

The following is a more advanced example that specifies a path to a relevant C and C++ compiler and
an installation directory.

```
$ CXX=/path/to/g++ CC=/path/to/gcc ./waf configure --prefix=/path/to/installation/dir
$ ./waf install
```

If successful hptest (along with qctool and other tools) will be installed in ``/path/to/installation/dir/usr/bin``
