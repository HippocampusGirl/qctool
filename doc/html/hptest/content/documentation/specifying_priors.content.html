By default HPTEST fits the model under a regularising prior. Priors are seperately specified for
each parameter (i.e. each parameter is a priori assumed independent).  By default the priors are as follows.

For the genetic predictor: a $\text{log-F}(2,2)$ prior is placed on the main effect, and a
$\text{log-F}(4,4)$ prior on the overdominance effect in the general model.

For covariates: a diffuse $\text{log-F}$ distribution with 95% of its mass similar to that of a
$N(0,40^2)$ prior is currently specified (this is $\text{log-F}(0.077,0.077)$).

The $\text{log-F}$ prior naturally arises in logistic regression as a posterior distribution and thus can naturally
thought of in terms of data augmentation. For example, the $\text{log-F}(2,2)$ distribution is the posterior of a
logistic regression problem applied to two samples with predictor equal to 1 and having outcome 0 and 1 respectively.
Thus, applying this prior can be considered a minimal way to state 'the effect is not infinite'. In practice it
resembles a Gaussian prior with similar 95% coverage, but is slightly more concentrated near zero and with fatter tails:
