By default HPTEST fits the model under a regularising prior. Priors are seperately specified for
each parameter (i.e. each parameter is a priori assumed independent).  By default the priors are as follows.

For the genetic predictor: a $\text{log-F}(2,2)$ prior is placed on the main effect, and a
$\text{log-F}(4,4)$ prior on the overdominance effect in the general model.

For covariates: a diffuse $\text{log-F}$ distribution with 95% of its mass similar to that of a
$N(0,40^2)$ prior is currently specified (this is $\text{log-F}(0.077,0.077)$).

The $\text{log-F}$ prior is discussed in Greendland
