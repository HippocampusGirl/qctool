To make analysis files nice to use, HPTEST lets you name a few things:

1. You can use ``-analysis-name`` to specify a name for your analysis. This is recorded in the
metadata in the output file. In sqlite output format, this becomes a bit more useful: it gets
recorded in the ``Analysis`` table, its start/end times in the ``AnalysisStatus`` table, and its
command-line options in the ``AnalysisProperty`` table. This lets you keep track of multiple HPTEST
runs output into the same sqlite output file.

2. Use ``-outcome-name`` to specify a name for the outcome variable. By default this is "outcome",
but it's often nicer to get HPTEST to put its real name into the output file. For example, in our
malaria study I used ``-outcome-name Pf``; the output columns were named e.g.
``add:beta_1:add/Pf=1`` instead of ``add:beta_1:add/outcome=1``.

3. Models can be given names - e.g. instead of ``-model add`` you can write ``-model
my_favourite:add``. (This is admittedly mostly useful for the ``add+het`` model, which is set up as
``-model gen:add+het`` by default so that the output columns are called "gen".)
